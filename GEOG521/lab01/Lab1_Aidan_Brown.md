## Deliverable 1

Is this grid an integer or floating point grid? And what does the count field indicate?

- The new grid is an integer grid. The count field represents all cells of the converted feature classes.

## Deliverable 2

What is the total area of the Madison Limestone (unit 7) in the new grid? Briefly explain how you
obtained your answer.

- 56951 M2

	I got the above answer by first selecting only Madison Limestone by the count attribute, going into the symbology of the **Limegrid** raster, changing the **Primary symbology** to **classify**, normalizing the data by **count**, going to the **more** option and there was where I found the total count.
