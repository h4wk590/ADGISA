## Deliverable 1

- Cell values are larger numbers when father away from the data source as the source point was the input data source when performing analysis using the **Distance Accumulation** tool. To conclude this, I viewed the attribute information of individual cell values around the **source** data point, and the **destination** data point.

## Deliverable 2

Carefully examine the back direction raster. What do the cell values represent? What are the
units, if any? Why is this raster needed for further analysis?

- Each cell value represents the angle of the slopes elevation in degrees. The data has been classified categorize the pixel values by compass direction.

## Deliverable 3

Brief description of your analysis steps (only for the step to determine the locations of the
crossings).

- Using the **Intersect** tool I was able to perform the analysis to determine where the least-cost path crosses the river, by specifying the inputs as the optimal distance raster intersected with the **river.shp.**

## Deliverable 4

How many river crossings are there for the least-cost path solution for scenario 1?

- 9 total river crossings.
