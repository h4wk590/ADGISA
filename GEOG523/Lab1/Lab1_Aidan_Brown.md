## Question 1: On what date (y/m/d) was this image acquired?

- 1999/09/21/


Question 2: What is the coordinate system for this image? More specifically, what are the projection and its  
parameters, what is the datum, and what are the imageryâ€™s coordinate bounds (in the Geographic coordinates)?

- Projection: UTM
- Datum: NAD83
- Coordinate Bounds: 

LL latitude - 048.248639696
LL longitude - -125.917169
UL latitude - 049.819597571
UL longitude - -125.3179582
LR latitude - 047.896828387
LR longitude - -123.5026422
UR latitude - 049.455307073
UR longitude - -122.8331045

## Question 3: What are the dimensions of a multispectral band? How many lines (rows) and pixels (columns)?

- Number_of_pixels_multi - 7690
- Number_of_lines_multi - 7346


## Question 4: What approximate ground area (in sq. km including null pixels) does this Landsat image cover? Show your  
calculations. Tip: Open any multispectral band of 048026_0100_990921_l7_X_utm10.tif in ArcGIS and examine grid  
cell size or spatial resolution parameter for a pixel from the Layer Properties dialog.

Columns squared + Rows squared * Combined multiplied Cell Size (7690^2 + 7346^2 * 900) = 

**48626 km2**
