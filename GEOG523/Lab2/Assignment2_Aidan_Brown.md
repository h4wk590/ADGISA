## Question 1

What does the histogram represent in general?

- The distribution of pixel values from 0 - 255 of the raster image.

## Question 2

Which spectral band has the largest frequency distribution range of brightness values? Support your  
claim by providing the minimum and maximum pixel values.

- **Band 4** has the largest distribution range of brightness values. Minimum value of 1, and maximum value of 198

## Question 3

Which band has the smallest frequency distribution range of brightness values? Support your claim by  
providing the minimum and maximum pixel values.


- **Band 2** has the smallest frequency of brightness values. The minimum pixel value is 18, and the highest is 175.

## Question 4

Which of two bands have the most similar histograms’ appearance (in terms of the shape and form of  
the histograms)? Explain your choice.

- **Band 1** and **Band 2**

These two bands have a very similar curve, and very similar highest pixel counts at around 12,000 for each histogram. 

## Question 5

Give one example of two bands that have very different histograms. Explain what makes these  
histograms different and relate your explanation back to the actual display of ground features within bands?

- **Bands 3 & 5**

The histography is immediately different visually as a first major difference between these two bands. Band 3 has a spike in terms of displaying more black values most likely showing more of the vegetation and water, while Band 5 has a small curve in the middle of the graph indicating more grey values to do with vegetation on the map.

## Question 6

Comment on the overall difference in pixel brightness values between the two image dates. By  
identifying Sub1999-1990-pixel values, provide at least three different examples (and their DNs, X, Y coordinates) of features that do not have experienced any change from September 1990 to September 1999.


| X Coordinate | Y Coordinate | Numeric Value 1999 - 1990 | Numeric Value ETM |
| -------| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 123°53'09.1447"W | 49°03'15.5152"N | 119 | 119 |
| 123°53'03.2877"W | 49°03'09.8038"N | 90 | 90 |
| 123°49'48.0275"W | 49°06'57.2964"N | 60 | 60 |


## Question 7

Identify Sub1999-1990-pixel values over the deep ocean surface. What factors might cause minor  
overall difference in brightness between the two multi-date images?

- Clouds may get in the way of the remote sensor when gathering images.
- Ocean currents, may cause variations because of forming waves.
- Day time versus night time sensing may cause slight variations.
