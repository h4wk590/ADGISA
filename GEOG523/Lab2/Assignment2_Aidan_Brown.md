## Question 1

What does the histogram represent in general?

- The distribution of pixel values from 0 - 255 of the raster image.

## Question 2

Which spectral band has the largest frequency distribution range of brightness values? Support your  
claim by providing the minimum and maximum pixel values.

- **Band 4** has the largest distribution range of brightness values. Minimum value of 1, and maximum value of 198

## Question 3

Which band has the smallest frequency distribution range of brightness values? Support your claim by  
providing the minimum and maximum pixel values.


- **Band 2** has the smallest frequency of brightness values. The minimum pixel value is 18, and the highest is 175.

## Question 4

Which of two bands have the most similar histogramsâ€™ appearance (in terms of the shape and form of  
the histograms)? Explain your choice.

- **Band 1** and **Band 2**

These two bands have a very similar curve, and very similar highest pixel counts at around 12,000 for each histogram. 

## Question 5

Give one example of two bands that have very different histograms. Explain what makes these  
histograms different and relate your explanation back to the actual display of ground features within bands?
