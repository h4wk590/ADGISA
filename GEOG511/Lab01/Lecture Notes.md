## Geodatabases



Vegetation Analysis calculation:

RVI =  NIR 1999 / R 1999

RVI = NIR 1990 / R 1990


- Look at the histogram for changes in curve (high pixel number is dense vegetation.) 
- Represented as a Boolean value (greater or not) based on the curve.

- NIR reflected much more with vegetation
- Red for soil.
