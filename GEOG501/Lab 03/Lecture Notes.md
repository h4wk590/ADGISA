## Coordinate Systems 

- A way to reference where we are to the world relevant to a point on the Earth.
- Light on the math
- Heavy on concepts

## Why?

- Without a coordinate system it isn't really GIS.
- No decimal degrees on a scaled map as it's a measurement for angles, not distance.

## From 3D Globe to 2D Map

- approximating the surface of the earth.
- projecting the 3D object to 2D

## Shape of the Earth

- The earth is a spheroid because a spinning mass compresses slightly out at it's equator.

## Ellipsoidal Earth

- Geoid - mean sea level (approximating the sea as if it were a flat surface.)

It isn't a perfect measurement, but using an ellipsoid we can more accurately describe and measure the surface of the Earth.

## Geoid vs. Ellipsoid 

- Ellipsoids are region based. 
- There are efforts to set a standard Ellipsoid for the global level but region based ellipsoids are still used.
- Earth's surface is very complex and is not a perfect shape. Therefore the Geoid is an approximated measurement to take into account Earth's changes topography.

## Geodetic Datum

- Is a datum for the world
- A specific ellipsoid and a point of origin (center of the world or the surface of the world.)
- Typically no more than two numbers.
