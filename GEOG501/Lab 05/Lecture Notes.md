## Creating and Editing Data

- Note heavily used but will still encounter digitizing. But will need to understand the basic workflow, whether we need to digitize 1 or 1000 edits.

## Digitizing and Scanning

Updating existing paper data.

### Tablet Digitizing

- Table of copper mesh
- Paper map was put on the table and used to digitize the map using exact movements.
- Paper coordinates to real world coordinates.

### Heads up digitizing 

- Computer based mapping.
- Sitting down at computer = heads up.


### Scanning

- **flat-bed** scanner for small pages
- **Drum-Scanner** (plotter) for larger maps.

### Digitizing Techniques

- Creating points, lines, and polygons.
- Start with the geometry and then add fields to the attribute table.
- Every point created is a vertex (P. vertices).
- First and last points of a line are called **nodes**.

### Sampling Frequency

- **Too little** will have poor accuracy and may not be good for analysis.
- **Too much** - Excess data, takes up a lot of space, slow processing.


### Workflow

- Start with feature class - start with one at a time.
- Go to **EDIT**.
- Click on the **Create pane**.
- In the pane click on the feature class.
- Pick a create tool.
- Now digitize
