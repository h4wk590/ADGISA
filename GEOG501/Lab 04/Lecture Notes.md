- Maps for this class should be easy and clear to read and always include a title.

## Recognize a map by:


- Places

- Light to dark colour scale.
- Normalized data is usually an average, number, ratio, fraction, etc.

## Need to know

## Proportional Symbol

- Total count, used to view differences between neighbouring entities (between provinces).

## Calculating Equal Intervals

```
interval = Max value - Min Value / # of classes
```
