### ArcGIS Tips

- Right click attribute table and select **statistics** for quick sums of selected objects. 

### Discrete vs Continuous 

Why is soil discrete and not continuous?

- Different types of soils
- Soil levels and elevation types

### Key Differences Between Raster and Vector Data

#### Vector Data

- Vector Data is real world data
- Geometry can be polygons, lines, points.
- Attribute tables provide info about the features (like building a building, road, telephone pole.)

#### Raster Data

- Raster data is a grid of equally sized cells 
- Each cell can contain different information such as
- Elevation
- Temperature
- air pressure
- Raster data does not have an attribute table


### Metadata

 Metadata describes GIS content by providing:

- Description of the content and intended use
- Author
- Date that data was made and was modified
- Descriptive tags

The more complete metadata from datasets generally means that the data is 'clean' and is better quality.
