GIS is recognizing pattens in a map, 

Several factors for implementing GIS

- Where to build something (School buildings)


## Ian McHarg

- Created Transparent overlays (mylar) (plastic sheets to view layers.)

## Roger Tomlinson

- Father of GIS
- Coined the term "GIS"
- Canadian Geographic Information System was the first GIS created, later changed to just GIS.

### Data for Decision (1968)

#### Things that have changed

- computationally processing is a lot fast.
- Size of computer.
- Data processed and stored on Tape.
- A lot less paper based. (collection/processing).

#### Things that are still mostly true

- Bureaucracy.
- Overlaying data as a concept is the same.
- Trying to automate repetitive and manual tasks.
- Supporting decisions and problems using GIS data.

### Components and functions of GIS

#### Components

- Hardware
- Software
- Data stored
- Procedures
- People

#### Functions

- Capture
- Query
- Store
- Analyze
- Display
- Output

### GIS Data Layers

- Breaking down reality in the form of layers. Logically organized layers.

### GIS is Just a Database

- Coordinate system is important for a project.
- Data sources should be designed to work together
- Logical consistency
- Meaningful integration between layers.
