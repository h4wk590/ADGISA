Several factors for implementing GIS

## Roger Tomlinson

- Father of GIS
- Coined the term "GIS"
- Canadian Geographic Information System was the first GIS created, later changed to just GIS.

### Data for Decision (1968)

#### Things that have changed

- computationally processing is a lot fast.
- Size of computer.
- Data processed and stored on Tape.
- A lot less paper based. (collection/processing).

#### Things that are still mostly true

- Bureaucracy.
- Overlaying data as a concept is the same.
- Trying to automate repetitive and manual tasks.
- Supporting decisions and problems using GIS data.
