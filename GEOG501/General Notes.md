### What is GIS?

- A way to analyze, and Visualize spatial data computationally, usually via maps.
- A way to communicate data for anyone to see. (hard to visualize a database as is.)
- Helps organizations, and governments, and people solve complex geographical issues.

### Why GIS?

- Specific needs of the individual/organization

**Think about how to visualize a problem using GIS..**

- Emergency response systems that show the quickest way to get to a destination
- Wanting to know where parks benches and picnic tables are in a specific park, or all parks in a city?
- Using business intelligence to track customer spending trends based on store locations.
- Mapping tree density and managing tree growth status within forestry.

### ArcGIS Tips

- Right click attribute table and select **statistics** for quick sums of selected objects. 

### Creating Feature Class from CSV Coordinate System

- Right click csv file from the catalog view:

- Hover over **export** and select either line, polygon, or ellipse feature class.

### Discrete vs Continuous 

Why is soil discrete and not continuous?

- Different types of soils
- Soil levels and elevation types

### Key Differences Between Raster and Vector Data

#### Vector Data

- Vector Data is real world data
- Geometry can be polygons, lines, points. (map scale matters for each of these)
- Attribute tables provide info about the features (like a building, roads, telephone pole.)

#### Raster Data

- Raster data is a grid of equally sized cells 
- Each cell can contain different information such as
- Elevation
- Temperature
- air pressure
- Raster data does not have an attribute table


### Metadata

 Metadata describes GIS content by providing:

- Description of the content and intended use
- Author
- Date that data was made and was modified
- Descriptive tags

The more complete metadata from datasets generally means that the data is 'clean' and is better quality.


### Coordinates


### The shape of the Earth

- The Earth is an ellipsoid, or more importantly a spheroid.
- It bulges out at the equator so it isn't a perfect sphere.


### Geographical Coordinate Systems

- 3 dimensional model that identifies points on the earth.
- Latitude (**parallels**)
- Longitude (**meridians**)

> If a map only contains 2 spatial properties 1 of them will always be direction.


#### Datum

- Is a frame of reference to define the position of the spheroid of the earth relative to the center of the datums position.
