## Tables and queries

- Table basics
- Table Associations
- Cardinality
- Field Manipulations

## Types of Tables

- Attribute Tables
- Stand-Alone Tables

### Attribute Tables

- Each feature class has an attribute.
- looking at the attributes associated with spatial data.
- One row for each geographic features.

### Stand-alone table

- Just a record.
- Text or coordinate that can be converted.
- Does not contain features.

## Table Formats

- .txt
- .csv
- xlsx
- DBF
- Geodatabase table

## Database Rules

- Field Names (no spaces, length, Cannot be blank field names, must be unique).
- ID (must be unique).
- Attribute values (Same type within one field).

## Primary Key

- Each value is unique.
- No null values.

## Table Associations


### Cardinality

- How many objects in one table are associated to how many objects in another table?

### Types of cardinality

- One to one - 1 field per table.
- One to many
- Many to one
- Many to many - looking for duplicates.


## Table Join

- Input table + join table
- Join field
- Temporary
- One -to-one and many-to-one

### Table Relates

- Like joining but doesn't force the data into a single table.
- Input table + relate table
- Join field
- Temporary
- All cardinalities, but mostly for one-to-many and many-to-many


## Queries

### Querying

- Syntax
- Structured approach to searching data
