## Deliverable 2

Describe the seasonal movement pattern of each of the two bears for the time period
considered. What behavior could explain their movements? 

Many points of travel are observed on the landmasses, this could indicate the bears hibernating and producing cubs. During this time the sea is frozen over so they must stay on land during hibernation. When spring and summer approach and the ice melts, it opens up more opportunities for the bears to hunt. You can see the poly-lines that go from **Svalbard** to points on the ocean, as these points may indicate hunting sessions.

# Deliverable 3

What distance did each bear travel over the time period considered, from October 2002 to
February 2004?

- Yena traveled **3705 KM**.
- Yana traveled **1637 KM**.

## Deliverable 4

Based on the fields for the address components in the reference data, which geocoding style is
best to use? Explain your answer.

Using **US Street address dual ranges** (Street Address) would best suit the reference data for this example, as the reference data provides some information about address ranges along streets. Furthermore, there is specific **street direction**, and **street numbers** components, there will need to be geocoordinates for each side of a polyline to indicate where a specific address will be located.   


## Deliverable 5

Screen capture of your address locator settings. Make sure to show a screen capture of the
style (under About the locator) and the field map showing the fields (under Reference data tables):
