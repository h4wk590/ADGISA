## Deliverable 2

Describe the seasonal movement pattern of each of the two bears for the time period
considered. What behavior could explain their movements? 

Many points of travel are observed on the landmasses, this could indicate the bears hibernating and producing cubs. During this time the sea is frozen over so they must stay on land during hibernation. When spring and summer approach and the ice melts, it opens up more opportunities for the bears to hunt. You can see the poly-lines that go from **Svalbard** to points on the ocean, as these points may indicate hunting sessions.

# Deliverable 3

What distance did each bear travel over the time period considered, from October 2002 to
February 2004?

- Yena traveled 3705 KM.
- Yana traveled 1637 KM
