## Data in GIS

- Data depends on the use case and are subjective by the GIS developer/analyst.
- Can be used to Represent a simplistic  view of physical locations and objects.
- Using polygons instead of satellite imagery increases system performance.


## Spatial Data Model

Also referred to as **thematic layers**

- Spatial database containing objects and (most of the time) sets of layers to describe the data presented.
- Provides GIS-level abstraction from the real world, which is then converted to data structures and binary data to be read at a computational level.

Example Spatial Data model (**thematic layers**) could be:

- Soils data layer - Includes only soil data.
- Population data layer - Includes information about population.
- Elevation data layer - Elevated zones that will be presented on a map.
- Roads data layer - Only roads will be presented in this layer.



## Attribute Data and Types


Attribute data are just **variables** or **items** that are:

- Often Stored in a table.
- Columns associate the attribute.
- rows associate the spatial object.

Attribute tables are managed and organized using a Database Management System (**DBMS**). 

Attributes are used to describe features or *characteristics* of a spatial object.
For example, a fire hydrant could have the following attributes:

- Colour.
- number of hose connections.
- water pressure rating.

These are all attributes that can be used within the attribute table to associate the different fire hydrant objects on a map.
