# Communication/Data Gathering (1 week)

## TASK

- Gather all data from 1985 and 2005 to compare, this would include any imagery to analyze.
- Communication with stakeholders
- Pilot test for one cell grid?
- Re-Project coordinate system to UTM.

# GIS Tasks (6 weeks)

## Digitizing 

- Digitize new 2005 polygons
- Symbolize cleared areas versus vegetated areas.

## Geoprocessing 

- The goal is to create a layer with the difference of the watersheds to the cut-blocks.
- Calculate the total disturbed areas in kilometers.

### Tool Considerations

- Clip the 2005 cut blocks with the 1985 polygons.
- Minus the 1985 clearings from 2005 clearings to get difference.
- Intersect watersheds polygons with 2005 clearings
- Summarize 
- Overlay

## Deliverables (2 weeks)

- Final Map layout (3 maps, 2005, 1985, and change)
- Report summarizing work done and total change percentages
