## Question 1

- a) 680 / 1200 x 100 = **56.67% complete.**
- b) 680 - 740 = Cost variance of **-60**.
- c) Project is **over-budgeted** because the cost variance is negative.
- d) 680 - 700 = Schedule variance of **-20**.
- e) Project is **behind schedule**. Schedule variance is negative.

## Question 2

- a) 875 / 900 x 100 = **97.22% complete**
- b) 875 - 820 = Cost variance of **55**.
- c) The project is **under budget** in this case.
- d)  875 - 820 = Schedule variance of **55**.
- e) This project is ahead of schedule.

## Question 3

- a) 10,386.50 / 12,499 x 100 = 83.09% completed
- b) 10,386.50 - 8,920 = **1,466.50 cost variance**
- c) 10,386.50 - 12,499 = **-2,112.50 schedule variance**.
- d) Task 1 and task 5 are both over budget.
- e) Task 4 and task 5 are both behind schedule. 

## Question 4

- a) 9,065 / 10,550.00 x 100 = **85.87% complete.**
- b) 9,065 - 9,025 = **cost variance of 40.**
- c) 9,065 - 10,550 = **schedule variance of -1,485.**
- Task 5 was over budget (1,900 - 2,050).
- Task 5 was behind schedule.

## Question 5



## Question 6




## Question 7

In the early months of the project, based on the earned amount and cost variance, the project was trending in a downwards position. But the project came back on track in the later months as the earned amount was consistently slightly above expended, as well as the project being under budget in the later months. This shows that despite the initial delays or inefficiencies the project was back on track and delivered under budget.
